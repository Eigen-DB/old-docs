# Overview

### The blazingly fast in-memory vector database ðŸš€

EigenDB is a light-weight in-memory vector database written in Go. It features the ability to perform similarity search, which utilizes the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm ([more](similarity-search.md)).

Basic database operations can easily be performed through its very simple [REST API](rest-api.md).

# Overview



* EigenDB is a light-weight in-memory vector database written in Go. It's also open-source! ❤️
* It features the ability to perform similarity search, which utilizes the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) algorithm ([more](whats-a-vector-database/similarity-search-in-eigendb.md)).
* Basic database operations can easily be performed through its very simple [REST API](rest-api.md).
